This 7 point framework will help government departments with the safe, sustainable and ethical use of automated or algorithmic decision-making systems.
It has been developed in line with guidance from government (such as theData Ethics Framework) and industry, as well as relevant legislation. It supports the priorities of the Central Digital and Data Office, and aligns with wider cross- government strategies in the digital, data and technology space.
