This guidance is available on the BSIA website.
Automated Facial Recognition (AFR) is a technology that has been designed to improve the safety and wellbeing of people, as well as providing a tool to assist and speed up operational processes. AFR is one of many data analysis
technologies which sit under the overarching umbrella of Artificial Intelligence (AI), a branch of Computer Science.
The ethics of AI and its application need to be regularly reviewed to ensure that it is not allowed to act autonomously without human oversight and it should not be used in any way which causes harm to individuals.
