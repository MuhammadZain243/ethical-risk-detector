A list of places to find Defence contracts and funding in the technology and innovative research and development (R&D) space.
Every year the Ministry of Defence (MOD) works with companies and researchers to develop next-generation innovation, technology and digital solutions to support our frontline troops. You can find some of the places we advertise those opportunities on this page. This is not an exhaustive list.
Opportunities outside the technology and innovation space can be found atProcurement atMOD.

A common way for suppliers to bid for contracts is via online platforms known as frameworks. These have standard terms and processes which make it easier to contract with us. Once you are on a framework you can apply for any advertised opportunities until the framework ends.
The frameworks cover a range of goods and services. Some are ‘dynamic’, which means they can be joined at any time. Others are only open during certain periods, so if you miss the sign up period you will need to wait for it to re-open again.
